                    <p>Texas Pollinators Entomology Guide was founded in 1898 by Texas locals. Their goal was to make
                        information about the most important pollinator species easily available. Rather than buying guide
                        books or doing difficult research, people should focus on preserving the species that are keeping our
                        ecosystems in balance.</p>

                    <p>Texas Pollinators Entomology Guide is a project of the Entomological Society of America (ESA). The
                        purpose of this website is to report interesting discoveries in the world of pollinator species science,
                        news and events from entomological societies, and to feature periodic articles by volunteer authors.</p>
                    <p><br>TPEG has been connecting entomologists and others with a fascination for pollinators for the past 125
                        years. ESA members total more than 7,000 individuals from around the world who study insects, their
                        importance, and their impact on the world’s population. And ESA certification’s program has provided
                        credentials for those who help control insect pests in urban environments.</p>
